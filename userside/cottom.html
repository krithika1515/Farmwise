        <p>Cotton is one of the most important fibre and cash crop of India as well as of entire world. It plays a dominant role in the industrial and agricultural economy of the country. It provides the basic raw material to cotton textile industry. In India it provides direct livelihood to 6 million farmers and about 40-50 million people are employed in cotton trade and its processing. Cotton is a water thirsty crop and around 6% of the water for irrigation in is used for its cultivation. In India, it is grown on a large scale in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh. Gujarat is the largest producer of cotton followed by Maharashtra and Punjab. It is vital kharif crop of Punjab. The average lint yield of the State is around 697 kg per hectare.</p>

    </div>
    <h2><b>SOIL</b></h2>

    <div class="container">
      <p>It can be grown on all type of soil having pH ranges in-between 6 and 8. Deep, friable, well drained and fertile soil are good for crop cultivation. Sandy, saline or water logged soils are not suitable for cotton cultivation. The depth of soil should not be less than 20-25 cm.

      </p>
    </div>

    <h3><b>VARIETIES & YIELD:</b></h3>

    <div class="container">
        <p><b>RCH 134BT:</b> It is high yielding Bt cotton variety. It is resistant to bollworm and American bollworm. It matures in 160-165 days. It give average yield of 11.5 qtl/acre of seed cotton. Very good fibre property with 34.4% ginning outturn.</br>
            <b>RCH 317BT:</b> It is high yielding Bt cotton variety. It is resistant to spotted bollworm and American bollworm. It mature in 160-165 days. Boll size is about 3.8 cm with good fluffy opening. Gives average yield of 10.5 qtl/acre. gives 33.9% of ginning outturn.</br>

    <h1><b>LAND PREPARATION:</b></h1>

    <div class="container">
        <img src="cottonImages//cotton land preparation.jpeg" alt="Manual Ploughing" width="200" height="200">
        <p>It required thorough land preparation for good germination and growth of crop. After removal of Rabi crop, irrigate field immediately then take ploughing of land with MB plough and planking. Carry out deep ploughing once in three years, it will help to keep check on perennial weeds also kill various soil borne pest and diseases.</p>

    <h3><b>SOWING</b></h3>

    <div class="container">
        <img src="cottonImages//cotton sowing.jpeg" alt="Sowing" width="200" height="200">
        <h4><b>Time of Sowing</b></h4>
        <p>Optimum time for sowing is in April - mid May. For Management of Mealybug, sow Bajra, Arhar, Maize and Jowar in the fields surrounding cotton crop. Avoid growing tur, moong and bhendi in and around cotton field as these harbour insect pests. In Punjab cotton wheat rotation is common but rotation with berseem and clusterbean has been found to have beneficial effect on the succeeding cotton crop.</p>

        <h4><b>Spacing</b></h4>
        <p>For American cotton use spacing of 75x15 cm under irrigated condition while under rain fed condition use spacing of 60x30 cm. For desi cotton use spacing of 60x30 cm for rain fed as well as for irrigated condition.</p>

        <h4><b>Sowing Depth</b></h4>
        <p>Sowing should be done at depth of 5 cm.</p>

        <h4><b>Method of Sowing</b></h4>
        <p>For sowing use seed drill for desi cotton while dibbling of seed is done in case of hybrids and Bt cotton. Square planting is beneficial compared to rectangular planting. Few gaps arise due to failure of seed germination and mortality of seedling. To overcome this gap filling is necessary. Two weeks after sowing the weak/diseased/damaged seedlings should be removed by keeping a healthy seedling/hill.</p>

    <h3><b>SEED:</b></h3>

    <div class="container">
        <img src="cottonImages//cotton seed.jpeg" alt="Seeds" width="200" height="200">
        <h3><b>SEED RATE</b></h3>
        <p>Seed rate varies with variety, growing zones, irrigation etc. Use seed rate for American cotton hybrid@1.5 Kg/acre while for American cotton variety use seed rate of 3.5 kg/acre. For desi cotton hybrid@1.25 kg/acre and 3 kg/acre for desi cotton varieties</p>

        <h3><b>SEED TREATMENT</b></h3>
        <p>Seed of cotton is covered by short fibre in American cotton. Before sowing removal of this necessary as it will make difficulty for sowing. It can be removed by chemical and Non-chemical method.

            In Non-chemical method, seeds are soaked in water overnight, then next day rubbed with cowdung and wood ash or saw dust then dried in shed before sowing.
            In chemical method, Depending upon the fibres on the seeds, mix the 400 gm concentrated Sulphuric acid (Industrial grade) in per 4 kg seeds for American cotton and 300 gm for 3 kg Desi cotton seed for 2-3 minutes. It will burn all the fibers of seeds. Then 10 Ltr of water in container, stir well and drained out the water. Wash the seeds for three times with normal water and then lime water (Sodium Bicarbonate@50gm/10Ltr of water) for 1 min. Give one more washing then dry the seeds in shed.
            Do not use Metal or wood container instead use plastic or earthen pot and use plastic glove by operator for chemical method.
            
            To protect from sucking pest attacks (upto 15-20 days) treat seeds with Imidacloprid (Confidor) 5-7ml or Thiamethoxam (CRUISER)@ 5-7gm/kg of seeds

<h3><b>PLANT PROTECTION:</b></h3>

<div class="container">
    <img src="cottonImages//cotton plant protection 1.jpg" alt="Plant Protection" width="200" height="200">
    <p><b>Fusarium wilt</b> Plants become stunted, yellow, followed by defoliation. Yellowing first occurs around leaf edges and advances inward. Infected plants fruit earlier and produce smaller bolls. It causes a blackening and discoloration just found in a ring just beneath the bark. It affect at all stage of crop.

        Use resistant variety to control Fusarium wilt. Avoid continuous planting of cotton in same field. Follow proper crop rotation. Provide good drainage. Treat seed with Trichoderma viride formulation @ 4 gm/kg of seed. To control prepare the solution of Thiophanate Methyl : Small, pale to brown, round or irregular spots of circular to @10 gm and Urea each of 50 gm/10 litre of water and apply near base of plants.
        </br>
        <img src="cottonImages//cotton plant protection 2.jpg" alt="Plant Protection" width="200" height="200"></br>

      <b>Alternaria Leaf</b>Alternaria Leaf spotsemi-circular size with broad margins appear on leaves. Affected leaves become dry and get fall off. It may causes cankers on stem. Infection is spread to boll, then rotting of boll occurred afterwards they get fall off. Plants stressed by drought, nutrient deficiency and other pests are more susceptible to the disease.
      To control this disease, spray Tebuconazole@1 ml/litre or Trifloxystrobin+Tebuconazole@ 0.6 g/litre, on 60th, 90th and 120 days after sowing. If infestation of disease is observed in field, spray with Copper Oxychloride or Captan@500 gm/200 Ltr of water per acre or 12% Carbendazim + 63% WP Mancozeb@25 gm/10 Ltr water.</p>
