            <P>Rice is the most important food crop of India covering about one-fourth of the total cropped area and providing food to about half of the Indian population. Punjab has made tremendous progress in rice productivity and production during the past 45 years. Due to use of high yielding varieties and new technology Punjab has given the title of "Rice Bowl of India".

    <h2><b>CLIMATE</b></h2>

    </div>
    <h2><b>SOIL</b></h2>

    <div class="container">
        <p>It can be grown on a variety of soils with low permeability and pH varying from 5.0 to 9.5. Sandy loam to loamy sand to silty loam to clay loams, silty to clayey loam soils with low permeability, free of water logging and sodicity are considered best for paddy cultivation.</p>

    </div>

    <h3><b>VARIETIES & YIELD:</b></h3>

    <div class="container">
        <p><b>PR 128: </b> PR 128 of rice is an improved version of PAU 201. It possesses long slender clear translucent grains. Its average plant height is 110 cm and matures in about 111 days after transplanting. It is resistant to all the 10 presently prevalent pathotypes of bacterial blight pathogen in the Punjab state. Its average paddy yield is 30.5 quintals per acre.<br>
            <b> Punjab Basmati 1:  </b>Developed by PAU Ludhiana. It has excellent cooking and eating quality. It is improved version of basmati 386. It is resistant to lodging and Bacterial Blight. .<br>
            <b>Pusa Punjab Basmati 2:  </b> : Early maturing variety i.e ready to harvest in 120 days. It is susceptible to bacterial blight. Its grains extra long, slender and possess excellent cooking quality. It is suitable for multiple cropping pattern. It gives average yield of 15.7 qtl/acre</p>
    </div>
    <h1><b>LAND PREPARATION:</b></h1>

    <div class="container">
        <img src="riceImages//rice land preparation.jpeg" alt="Manual Ploughing" width="200" height="200">
        <p>After harvesting of wheat grow dhaincha (seed rate 20 kg/acre) or sunhemp @ 20 kg/acre or cowpea @ 12 kg/acre up to first week of May. When crop is of 6-8 week old, bury them into the soil one day before transplanting of paddy. It will save 25 kg of N per acre. Use laser land leveler for land levelling. After then puddle soil and to obtained fine well levelled puddle field to reduce water loss through percolation.</p>

    <h3><b>SOWING</b></h3>

    <div class="container">
        <img src="riceImages//rice sowing.jpeg" alt="Sowing" width="200" height="200">
        <h4><b>Time of Sowing</b></h4>
        <p>20 may to 5 june is the optimum time for sowing .</p>

        <h4><b>Spacing</b></h4>
        <p>For normal sown crop a spacing of 20 - 22.5 cm between rows is recommended. When sowing is delayed a closer spacing of 15-18 cm should be adopted.</p>

        <h4><b>Sowing Depth</b></h4>
        <p>The seedlings should be transplanted at 2 to 3 cm depth. Shallow planting gives better yields. </p>

        <h4><b>Method of Sowing</b></h4>
        <p>Broadcasting method</p>
    </div>
    <h3><b>NURSERY MANAGEMENT AND TRANSPLANTING</b></h3>
    <div class ="container">
        <p>Before sowing, soak them in 10 Ltr water containing, Carbendazim@20gm+ Streptocycline@1gm for 8 to 10 hour before sowing. After then dry seeds in shade. And then use for sowing.</br>

            Nursery Preparation: 15th to 30th May is the optimum time for nursery preparation.</br>
             <br>
            Wet bed nursery: It is done in region having adequate water availability. Nursery area is about 1/10 of the area to be transplanted. Broadcast Pre-germinated seeds on puddled and levelled soil. Keep the beds moist for the first few days. Do not flood the beds. When the seedlings are about 2 cm high, keep the beds submerged in a shallow layer of water. Apply dose of 26 kg/acre Urea about a fortnight after sowing. For transplantation use seedlings of 15-21 days or when seedlings are 25-30 cm long. Regularly irrigated the nursery. </br>
            <br>
            <b>Dry Bed: </b> It is prepared in dry soil condition. Total seed bed area is about 1/10 of the area to be transplanted. Make seed bed of convenient dimensions with the soil raised at height of 6-10 cm. Spread half burned rice husk on these beds for easy uprooting. Irrigation should be done properly because less moisture can damage seedling. Incorporate basal fertilizer for proper nutrients.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Modified Mat nursery:</b> This is the modified method of nursery making which require less space and less quantity of seeds. It can be cultivated at any place having flat surface and assured water supply. The area needed is about 1% of the transplantable land. Establishing seedlings in 4 cm layer of soil mix, arranged on a firm surface. Make 1 meter wide and 20-30 meter long plot and spread plastic sheet or banana leaves on it. Place a wooden frame with 4 cm deep and then fill the frame with soil mixture. Sow pre-germinated seed in it and cover the seed with dry soil. Immediately sprinkle water on it. Irrigate frame as and when needed and keep it moist. Seedlings are ready for transplanting within 11 to 14 days of sowing. Transport seedling mat to field and separate them and transplant 1-2 seedlings at 20x20 cm or 25x25 cm spacing.  </br>
            <br>
            <b>Depth of planting:</b> The seedlings should be transplanted at 2 to 3 cm depth. Shallow planting gives better yields.</br>
            
            <br>
           <b> Method of Transplanting </b>
            
            1) Flat puddled transplanting: Transplant seedlings in line at 20x15 cm for normal and 15x15 cm for late transplanting. Put 2 seedlings per hill and the seedlings should be transplanted upright and about 2-3 cm deep.
            
            2) Bed Transplanting: Transplant seedlings on middle of slopes of bed. These bed are prepared by wheat bed planter in heavy soil. Before transplanting irrigate the furrows, then transplant seedlings by maintaining a plant to plant distance of 9 cm.
            
            3) Mechanical transplanting: For transplanting Mat type nursery, mechanical transplanter are used. It transplant seedlings at spacing of 30x12 cm.

<h3><b>IRRIGATION:</b></h3>

    <img src="riceImages//rice irrigation.jpeg" alt="Drip Irrigation" width="200" height="200">
    <p>Keep field flooded up to two weeks after transplanting. When all water gets infiltrated two day after apply irrigation in field. Depth of standing water should not exceed 10 cm. While doing intercultural and weeding operation, drain out excess water from field and irrigate field after completion of this operations. Stop irrigation about a fortnight before maturity to facilitate easy harvesting.</p>

    <p><b>Root Weevil</b> : The presence of root weevil can be detected by the root and leave damage of yield. These are white legless grub feeds mainly on root. Plant gives yellow appearance, growth gets stunted and few tillers are form.
        If incidence is observed apply Carbaryl (4G)@10 kg either Phorate (10 G)@4 kg or Carbofuran (3 G) @10 kg per acre.
