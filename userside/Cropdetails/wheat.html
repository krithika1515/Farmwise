        <p>Wheat is grown on 13 percent of the cropped area of India. Next to rice, wheat is the most important food-grain of India and is the staple food of millions of Indians, particularly in the northern and north-western parts of the country.                                                                                                                    
            It is rich in proteins, vitamins and carbohydrates and provides balanced food. India is the fourth largest producer of wheat in the world after Russia, the USA and China and accounts for 8.7% of the world’s total production of wheat

    </div>
    <h2><b>SOIL</b></h2>

    <div class="container">
        <p>Soils with a clay loam or loam texture, good structure and moderate water holding capacity are ideal for wheat cultivation. Heavy soil with good drainage is suitable for wheat cultivation under dry conditions.</p>
    </div>

    <h3><b>VARIETIES & YIELD:</b></h3>

    <div class="container">
        <p><b>PBW 752: </b>Late variety. This variety is suitable for sowing in irrigated conditions. It gives an average yield of 19.2qtl/acre..<br>
            <b>PBW 1 Zn: </b> The plant of this variety attains the height of 103 cm. the crop is ready to harvest in 151 days. It gives an average of 22.5 qtl/acre of crop yield..<br>
            <b>UNNAT PBW 343: </b> : Suitable for irrigated and timely sown areas. Ready to harvest in 155 days. It is resistant to lodging, water logging conditions. It is also resistant to karnal bunt and tolerant to blight. It gives average yield of 23.2 qtl/acre.</p>
    </div>
    <h1><b>LAND PREPARATION:</b></h1>

    <div class="container">
        <img src="wheatImages//wheat land preparation.jpeg" alt="Manual Ploughing" width="200" height="200">
        <p>After harvest of previous crop, the field should be ploughed with disc or mould board plough. Field is usually prepared by giving one deep plough with iron plough followed by two or three times local plough and planking. Carried out plough in evening time and kept furrow open whole night to absorb some moisture from dew. Planking should be done after each plough early in the morning..</p>

    <h3><b>SOWING</b></h3>

    <div class="container">
        <img src="wheatImages//wheat sowing image.jpeg" alt="Sowing" width="200" height="200">
        <h4><b>Time of Sowing</b></h4>
        <p>Wheat must be sown at the optimum time. Delayed sowing causes a gradual decline in the yield of wheat. The time of sowing is 25 October – November.</p>

        <h4><b>Spacing</b></h4>
        <p>For normal sown crop a spacing of 20 - 22.5 cm between rows is recommended. When sowing is delayed a closer spacing of 15-18 cm should be adopted.</p>

        <h4><b>Sowing Depth</b></h4>
        <p>The sowing depth should be 4-5 cm..</p>

        <h4><b>Method of Sowing</b></h4>
        <p>1. Seed drill
            2. Broadcasting method
            3. Zero tillage drill
            4. Rotavator</p>

        <h3><b>SEED RATE</b></h3>
        <p>Use seed rate of 45 kg per acre. The seed should be cleaned and graded thoroughly before sowing.</p>
        <h3><b>SEED TREATMENT</b></h3>
        <p>For seed treatment use any one fungicide from the following:</p>

<h3><b>PLANT PROTECTION:</b></h3>

<div class="container">
    <img src="wheatImages//wheat plant protection.jpg" alt="Plant Protection" width="200" height="200">
    <p><b>Aphids:</b> These are nearly transparent, soft-bodied sucking insects. When present in sufficient numbers, aphids can cause yellowing and premature death of leaves. Infestation usually occurs during second fortnight of January till crop harvesting.
    
        For management of Aphid, use chrysoperla predators 5-8 thousand/acre or use 50 ml/Ltr neem concentrate. In cloudy weather infestation of aphid is occurred. Spray with Thiamethoxam@80gm or Imidacloprid 40-60 ml/ acre in 100 Ltr of water.</br>
        <img src="wheatImages//wheat plant protection 1.jpg " alt="Plant Protection" width="200" height="200"></br>

      <b>Termite:</b> Termites attack the crop at various growth stages, from seedlings to maturity. The severely damaged plants can be easily uprooted and look wilted and dried. In case roots are partially damaged, the plants show yellowing. To control broadcast 1 Ltr of Chlorpyriphos 20 EC mix with 20 kg sand/acre then applies a light irrigation.
