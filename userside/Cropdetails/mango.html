        <p>It is known as king of fruits and cultivated in India from old time. Mango is rich source of Vitamin A and C; its leaves are used as fodder in case of shortage of fodder while wood is used for furniture making. Unriped fruits are used for chutney, pickles and ripe fruits are used for eating purpose as well as for syrups, jam and jelly. It is commercially cultivated in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, West Bengal, Kerala, Bihar, UP, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra, Gujarat.</p>

    <h1><b>LAND PREPARATION:</b></h1>

    <div class="container">
        <img src="mangoImages//mango land preparation.jpeg" alt="Manual Ploughing" width="200" height="200">
         <p>Do ploughing, cross ploughing of land and then levelled the land. Prepare land in such way that water stagnation should not occurred in field. After levelling take one deeper ploughing and then divide lands in blocks. Spacing is varied from place to place.</p>   </div>

    
    <h3><b>SOWING</b></h3>

    <div class="container">
        <img src="mangoImages//mango sowing.jpeg" alt="Sowing" width="200" height="200">
        <h4><b>Time of Sowing</b></h4>
        <p>Planting is done in month of August-September also in February - March. Do planting in cool hours of evening. Protect crop from high wind.</p>

        <h4><b>Spacing</b></h4>
        <p>For grafted varieties use distance of 9m x 9m and plant them in square system. </p>
        <h4><b>Sowing Depth</b></h4>
        <p>Dug pits of 1x1x1m size at distance of 9x9m one month earlier before planting. Expose them to sun. Fill with mixture of soil, 30 to 40 kg of FYM or Compost and 1 kg single super phosphate.</p>

        <h4><b>Method of Sowing</b></h4>
        <p>Square and hexagonal planting can be adopted. Hexagonal planting accommodates 15% more plants.</p>

    <h3><b>SEED:</b></h3>

    <div class="container">
        <img src="mangoImages//mango seed.jpeg" alt="Seeds" width="200" height="200">
        <!-- <h3><b>SEED RATE</b></h3>
        <p>Seed rate varies with variety, growing zones, irrigation etc. Use seed rate for American cotton hybrid@1.5 Kg/acre while for American cotton variety use seed rate of 3.5 kg/acre. For desi cotton hybrid@1.25 kg/acre and 3 kg/acre for desi cotton varieties</p> -->

        <h3><b>SEED TREATMENT</b></h3>
        <p>Before planting, dip stones in solution of Dimethoate for few minutes. It will protect crop from mango weevils. Seed treatment with Captan fungicide protects seeds from fungal infections.</p>

    <h3><b>FERTILIZER REQUIREMENT:</b></h3>

<div class="container">
    <img src="mangoImages//fertilizer.PNG" alt="Fertilizer Requirement" width="100%" height="200">
    <p>Mango crop required 27 kg of N, P2O5 about 7 kg and 30 kg of K2O per acre. For crop of 1-3 year old, Apply 5 to 20 kg of well decomposed cow dung, 100-200 gm of Urea, 250-500 gm of Single super Phosphate and 175-350 gm of MOP per tree. For 4-6 year old crop apply increased cow dung dose by 25 kg, give Urea@200-400 gm, SSP@500-700 gm and MOP@350-700 gm per Tree.
 
        For 7-9 year old crop, apply 60-90 kg of well decomposed cow dung, Urea@400-500 gm, SSP@750-1000 gm, MOP@700-1000 gm per tree. For 10 year or above 10 year crop, apply 100 kg of well decomposed cow dung, Urea@400-500 gm, SSP@1000 gm and MOP@1000 gm per Tree.
        Give N and K dose of fertilizer in February month whereas apply whole amount of cow dung and SSP in December month.</p>

<h3><b>IRRIGATION:</b></h3>

<div class="container">
    <img src="mangoImages//mango irrigation.jpeg" alt="Drip Irrigation" width="200" height="50">
    <p>Amount and interval of irrigation depend upon, type of soil, climate and source of irrigation. To young plant apply light and frequent irrigation. Light irrigation always give best results as compared to flood irrigation. In summer apply irrigation at interval of 5-7days where as in winter slowly increased irrigation interval to 25-30days. In rainy season, apply irrigation depending upon rainfall intensity. Bearing trees required irrigation during fruit development period at interval of 10-12days. After fertilizer application in February month give light irrigation.</p>

<h3><b>PLANT PROTECTION:</b></h3>

<div class="container">
    <img src="mangoImages//mango plant protection 1.jpg" alt="Plant Protection" width="200" height="200">
    <p><b>Mealy Bug:</b> It causes damage to crop by sucking sap from inflorescences, stem, leaves and shoot. Infestation observed mostly in January to April. Mealy bug affected part dried and sooty mould is seen on infected parts.

        To prevent tree from mealy bug infestation, 25cm width Polythene(400gauge) strip fastened around tree trunk to stop ascent of nymphs before hatching of eggs in month of Nov and Dec. If infestation is observed, spray Acephate@2gm/Ltr or Spirotetramat@3ml/Ltr of water to control mealy bug.

      <b>Mango Fruit Fly:</b>Infestation is observed mostly in February-March Month when crop is in flowering stage. They suck sap from inflorescences, leaves. On infection flower get sticky and sooty mould a black color fungus is developed on affected parts.

      If infestation is observed take Spray Cypermethrin 25EC @3ml or Deltamethrin 28EC@9ml or Fenvelarate20EC@5ml or Neembicidine 1000ppm@20ml in 10Ltr water on whole tree.
